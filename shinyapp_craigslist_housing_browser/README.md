# shinyapp "Craigslist housing browser"

A shiny app to browse recent craigslist 'housing/apts' data for several cities.

Features:

- Sort by price, size, title, number of bedrooms.
- Links to original posts.
- Plots comparing the cities and within cities to give an overall picture.

How to deploy:

This app worked fine locally but all the on-the-fly downloading and parsing seemed kind of slow when deployed on RStudio's shiny server, so: [http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/deployment-local.html](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/deployment-local.html)
